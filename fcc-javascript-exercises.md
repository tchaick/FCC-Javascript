## BASIC JAVASCRIPT
---
## Exercise 1: Comment Your JavaScript Code
Try creating one of each type of comment.

```
// I-type ang double forward slash para magdagdag ng inline comment.

/* Gayahin ang format na ito 
kung kinakailangan magdagdag ng
mahabang multi-line comment */
```
## Exercise 2: Declare JavaScript Variables
Use the var keyword to create a variable called myName.

```
var myName;
```

## Exercise 3: Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
Assign the value 7 to variable a.

```
// Setup
var a;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;
```

## Exercise 4: Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another
Assign the contents of a to variable b.

```
// Setup
var a;
a = 7;
var b;

// Only change code below this line
b = a
```

## Exercise 5: Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator
Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9

```
var a = 9;
```

## Exercise 6: Declare String Variables
Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

```
var myFirstName = "John";
var myLastName = "Javier";
```
* We declare a variable with the keyword "var" in JavaScript, unlike in Python we do not. And end each with a ";". "let" and "const" are used instead of "var" in modern JavaScript development, ref: ES6.*

## Exercise 7: Understanding Unitiatialized Variables
Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.

```
// Only change code below this line
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
// Only change code above this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
```


## Exercise 7: Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase. Do not create any new variables.

```
// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
```

## Exercise 8: Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords
Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.

```
let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";
```
